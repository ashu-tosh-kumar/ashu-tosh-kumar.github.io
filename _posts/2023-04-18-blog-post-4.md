Are you tired of manually tracking your TODOs in Python projects? Do you wish there was
a tool that could scrape and summarize all your TODOs for you? Look no further than TODO
Notifier, an open source project available on GitHub , PyPi , ProductHunt and
SourceForge.

At my last company, I had the pleasure of using a tool that automatically summarized all
the TODO items in a Python project and sent periodic reminders to individual developers
to complete them. The tool was incredibly helpful, especially since it could identify
expired and upcoming TODOs with an expected completion date in a recommended format.

When I moved to a new company, I realized how much I missed that tool. So, I decided to
take matters into my own hands and develop a similar tool myself. It was a challenging
but rewarding experience, and Iâ€™m excited to share my journey of building a Python TODO
management tool.

With TODO Notifier, you can easily set up automated summaries of all your TODO items in
code by module, as well as lists of all expired TODO items and upcoming (to be expired)
TODO items based on expiry date. Plus, you can customize the tool to automatically
generate and send these summaries over email, keeping your project clean and reminding
individual developers (not yet implemented) to finish their TODO items before their
expiry date.
