Are you tired of tracking your TODOs in Python projects? Do you wish there was a tool
that could scrape and summarize all your TODOs for you? Checkout the TODO Notifier, an
open source project available on GitHub and PyPi.

At my last company, I had the pleasure of using a tool that summarized all the TODO
items in a Python project. It would send periodic reminders to individual developers to
complete them. The tool was helpful and could identify expired and upcoming TODOs with
an expected completion date.

When I moved to a new company, I realized how much I missed that tool. So, I decided to
take matters into my own hands and develop a similar tool myself. It was a challenging
but rewarding experience. And Iâ€™m excited to share my journey of building a Python TODO
management tool.

With TODO Notifier, you can set up automated summaries of TODO items in your code by
module. It also lists all expired and upcoming TODO items based on expiry date.
Moreover, you can customize the tool to generate and send these summaries over email.
And send reminders to individual developers (upcoming feature) to finish their TODO
items.
