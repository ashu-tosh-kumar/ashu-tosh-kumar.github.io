Depression, Anxiety, Stress, etc.; there are so many of these undesired dominant states
in our life that we want to avoid. I am writing all these states together here, but by
no means, they are all the same. Our aim here is not to be pedantic about differences
among them, so I would be referring to all such states as unpleasant states.

There are three critical questions that I want to answer here. I believe that reading,
acknowledging and reflecting on answers to these questions might help your own
situation.

- **How it starts?**
- **How to get out?**
- **How not to fall back?**
