This is a question that has haunted me for years, and I could never begin for a long
time. Finally, it turned out to be a simple lesson: “start by doing”, and that’s all
that is required. The only problem in this statement is what exactly to start with.

I am from a non-CSE Department and chose to have a career in Software Engineering to
pursue my passion for programming and so I had to start from zero myself. After nearly 8
months of coding practice, I landed with an offer from a good MNC. Here I am laying down
a simple step-wise plan that I think might help you to start from zero. Though it is not
the only plan that would work and you don’t need to stick to it strictly, but I think it
helps to have a concrete plan to compare with in case you have your own road-map. In
fact, once you start having a hang of coding (that you will after practicing around
60–80 easy level questions), you might not even need to further follow this plan, but it
would still be handy to check if you miss any topic.
