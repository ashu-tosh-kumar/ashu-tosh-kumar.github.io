This is a question that has haunted me for years, and I could never begin for a long
time. Finally, it turned out to be a simple lesson: “Start by doing”, and that’s all
that is required. The only problem in this statement is what exactly to start with.

I am from a non-CSE Department and chose to have a career in Software Engineering. So, I
had to start from zero myself. After 8 months of coding practice, I landed an offer from
a good MNC. Here I am laying down a simple step-wise plan that might help you to start
from zero. Though it is not the only plan that would work and you don’t need to stick to
it. But it helps to have a concrete plan to compare with in case you have your own road
map. In fact, once you start having a hang of coding (after solving 60–80 easy-level
questions), you would not even need to further follow this plan. But, it would still be
handy to check if you miss any topic.
