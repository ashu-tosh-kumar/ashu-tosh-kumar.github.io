Wox is a full-featured launcher for the Windows platform. It’s akin to Mac’s Spotlight
and can be augmented by a plethora of plugins.

I have been using Wox (with the almighty Everything plugin) for several years now and
have loved it. But I have always resented the unavailability of a working English
dictionary plugin that would also work offline. So, I embarked on developing a plugin
for myself but was frustrated by the lack of documentation available to do the same.

Below, I am sharing how I developed a dictionary plugin, Easy Dictionary, using Python.
I hope it would help you in your quest to develop another Python-based plugin. Easy
Dictionary can be installed from the official Wox plugin website. The source code is
available on GitHub. Please check it out and you’d understand why I named it an “Easy”
dictionary.
