[In Progress]

Stack Scraper is a sample repository showcasing how to write impeccably clean code that
will save your sanity. It is in correspondence to my Medium article published by
[gitconnected](https://gitconnected.com/): [How to Write Impeccably Clean Code That Will Save Your
Sanity](https://medium.com/gitconnected/how-to-write-impeccably-clean-code-that-will-save-your-sanity-7d0ea59d285c).

Stack-Scraper contains one scrapper that can be triggered on demand. It scrapes questions and answers from Stack Overflow. We are making the following assumptions about Stack Overflow.
    Stack Overflow is a single-page website.
    All the questions are numbered in integers.
    Each question has only one answer which could be accepted or not.
