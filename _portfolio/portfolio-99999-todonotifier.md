More often than not, we put some TODO items in code and forget about them. Sometimes, we
think of coming back to a TODO item by some date but miss it being too busy with some
other development.

TODO Notifier aims to solve this problem. It parses through any project, collects all
the TODO items, generates automated summaries and sends automated reminders about them.

Let's first see TODO Notifier in action.
