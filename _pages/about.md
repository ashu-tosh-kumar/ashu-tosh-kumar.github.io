Hi there! Meet an ambitious engineering professional with vast experience in e2e
full-stack software development using Python, ReactJS, PostgreSQL and Cassandra.
Equipped with a strong engineering background and academic qualifications, including a
Minor in Mathematics & Computing, a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering, and an M.Tech in
Systems Design from [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/).

My current interests revolve around generative Machine Learning, asynchronous
